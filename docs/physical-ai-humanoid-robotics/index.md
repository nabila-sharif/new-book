# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational module. This comprehensive course covers the fundamentals of creating intelligent robotic systems that bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and physical interaction.

## Course Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/module1-intro)

Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) and how it serves as the nervous system of a robot, enabling different components to communicate and coordinate effectively.

### [Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](/docs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/chapter1-ros2-fundamentals)

Deep dive into ROS 2 concepts including nodes, topics, services, and actions. Practice with hands-on exercises to create your first ROS 2 nodes.

### [Chapter 2: Python-based AI Agent](/docs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/chapter2-ros2-python-communication)

Explore how to create AI agents using Python and rclpy that can process sensor data and translate AI decisions into robot actions.

### [Chapter 3: Humanoid Robot Modeler](/docs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/chapter3-urdf-humanoid-structure)

Master URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) to define humanoid robot structure, understanding links, joints, and kinematic chains.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand and implement ROS 2 communication patterns
- Create Python-based AI agents that control robot behavior
- Model humanoid robots using URDF for simulation and control
- Integrate AI decision-making with physical robot actions

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Fundamental understanding of AI concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line (helpful but not required)

Begin with [Module 1 Introduction](/docs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/module1-intro) to start your journey into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
