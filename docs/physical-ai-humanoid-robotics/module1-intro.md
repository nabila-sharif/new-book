# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational module. This module focuses on understanding how robots communicate and process information using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which acts as the nervous system of a robot.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the role of ROS 2 in physical AI systems
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Implement Python-based AI agents that communicate with robots through ROS 2
- Define humanoid robot structure using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Understanding the core concepts of ROS 2
2. **Python-based AI Agent** - Creating AI agents using Python and rclpy
3. **Humanoid Robot Modeler** - Designing robot structure with URDF

Let's begin exploring how ROS 2 enables robots to communicate and function as intelligent systems.
