# Quick Start Guide: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This guide will help you get started with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational content.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository containing this educational content
2. Navigate to the `frontend_book` directory
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend_book
npm install
```

## Running the Development Server

To run the documentation site locally:

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens the documentation in your default browser. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Building for Production

To build the static site for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates a `build` directory with the static files that can be deployed to any web server or hosting service.

## Accessing the Content

Once the development server is running, you can access the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics content at:

- Main index: [Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics](http://localhost:3000/docs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics)
- Module 1 Introduction: [Module 1 Intro](http://localhost:3000/docs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/module1-intro)
- Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals: [Chapter 1](http://localhost:3000/docs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/chapter1-ros2-fundamentals)
- Chapter 2: Python-based AI Agent: [Chapter 2](http://localhost:3000/docs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/chapter2-ros2-python-communication)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure you're in the `frontend_book` directory
2. Verify that Node.js and npm are properly installed
3. Run `npm install` again if you see module import errors
4. Check that you have the latest version of the repository
