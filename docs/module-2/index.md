Welcome to **Module 2** of the *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics* book.

This module focuses on creating **digital twins** for humanoid robots using **Gazebo** and **Unity**, with an emphasis on physics-accurate simulation, environment realism, and sensor fidelity.

---

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:

- **Chapter 1 – Digital Twins & Physics Simulation (Gazebo)**  
  Create physics-accurate simulation environments with realistic gravity, collisions, joint dynamics, and contact modeling.

- **Chapter 2 – High-Fidelity Environments & Interaction (Unity)**  
  Build visually realistic environments with high-fidelity rendering and human–robot interaction capabilities.

- **Chapter 3 – Sensor Simulation & Data Fidelity**  
  Simulate realistic robot sensors including **LiDAR**, **Depth Cameras**, and **IMUs**, with proper noise and latency models.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Design physics-accurate digital twins of humanoid robots using Gazebo
- Develop high-quality visual environments in Unity for robotics simulation
- Simulate real-world robotic sensors with high data fidelity
- Combine physics, rendering, and sensing into a unified digital twin pipeline

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- A basic understanding of robotics and simulation concepts
- Familiarity with ROS or ROS 2 (recommended)
- Introductory knowledge of Gazebo or Unity (helpful but not required)
