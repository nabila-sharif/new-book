Welcome to **Module 3** of the *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics* book.

This module focuses on **advanced perception, simulation, and navigation** for humanoid robots using **NVIDIA Isaac™ technologies**, bridging the gap between simulation and real-world autonomy.

---

## Overview

This module covers the core technologies required to build intelligent humanoid robots using NVIDIA’s Isaac ecosystem:

- **Isaac Sim**  
  Photorealistic simulation environments and large-scale synthetic data generation for training perception models.

- **Isaac ROS**  
  Hardware-accelerated perception pipelines, including **Visual SLAM (VSLAM)** and localization.

- **Nav2**  
  Advanced path planning and navigation, adapted for **bipedal humanoid movement**.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** for photorealistic humanoid simulation
- Generate synthetic datasets for training AI perception models
- Implement hardware-accelerated **Visual SLAM** using Isaac ROS
- Configure **Nav2** for humanoid robot navigation
- Integrate perception, localization, and navigation into a unified autonomy stack

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- A basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with **ROS or ROS 2**
- Introductory knowledge of computer vision and robot navigation

---

## Summary

In this module, you learned:

- How to create photorealistic simulations using **Isaac Sim**
- How to implement perception and localization with **Isaac ROS**
- How to configure **Nav2** for humanoid navigation and path planning

These components together form the **AI brain** of a modern humanoid robot.
