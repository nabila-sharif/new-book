# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This educational book covers the fundamentals of creating intelligent robotic systems that bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and physical interaction.

## Course Structure

This comprehensive course is organized into multiple modules that progressively build your understanding of physical AI and humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Learn ROS 2 fundamentals and communication patterns
- **Module 2**: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Create simulation environments for robot development
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Advanced perception, simulation, and navigation
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Convergence of LLMs and robotics

## Getting Started

Begin with [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics) to start your journey into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
